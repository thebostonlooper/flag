Interactive American Flag
This project provides a web-based representation of the American flag built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The flag is rendered in the browser with attention to detail, featuring 50 stars and 13 stripes to accurately represent the real flag.

Features
Realistic Design: The flag incorporates the correct number of stripes and stars, and the stars are styled to look more like actual star shapes rather than squares or circles.

Interactive: Clicking anywhere on the flag toggles its colors to an alternate scheme and back.

How It Works
HTML provides the basic structure.
CSS is used for styling, including making the stars appear like actual star shapes using pseudo-elements.
JavaScript is used to dynamically generate and position the 50 stars and 13 stripes. It also toggles the flag colors when clicked.
